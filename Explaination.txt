YAML stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language, and this file format technology is used in documents.
These documents are saved in plain text format and are appended with the .yml extension.
Efficient data serialization was the main objective of the developers of the .yml format, since it enables users to create .yml files with content independent from any particular markup language.


So,the basic rules are :

1. Words written before colon(:) are predefined keywords
2. Words written after colon(:) are userdefined words
Ex : in my yml file i have taken 2 images one is of wordpress and the other is mysql
3. put Hyphen(-) in next line of colon to make an array under that keyword
